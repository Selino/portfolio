    <h1>CLIENT SIDE</h1>
    <p>At this stage of the game, it seems like writing clean and cross  browser compliant basic <strong>HTML</strong>/<strong>CSS</strong> is a given. I tend to work  in <strong>Chrome</strong>, check in IE, and follow up with Firefox/Safari. This system allows the majority audience to be addressed first  and the subsequent users to not fall through the cracks.</p>
    <p><strong>Javascript</strong> has taken the place of a lot of Flash functionality on the web. <strong>AJAX/JSON</strong> functions have even helped bridge the gap between Flash and  database calls for some. Never before has strong JS been so important to  layout, user interaction, and back end communication.</p>
    <p>Code libraries are quickly becoming the standard rather than a luxury. Prototype/Scriptaculous was the first such collection that I  began to use on a regular basis. A year later I switched to <strong>JQuery</strong> due to reputation and the release of JQuery UI.  The two are nearly identical in functionality and syntax but a comfortable  relationship with both has advantages when it comes to extending existing sites  with one or the other installed.</p>
    <p><strong>NodeJS | BackboneJS | HandlebarJS | RequireJS | UnderscoreJS</strong>... Kind of a game changer for me. Javascript MVC applications?! What?!</p>

    <h1>SERVER SIDE FRAMEWORKS</h1>
    <p>I've established a solid level in <strong>CakePHP</strong> which is a framework built on PHP. It  delivers the same rapid development  for MVC structured applications that JQuery and Prototype helped create for  Javascript. Think Ruby on Rails on a PHP backbone.</p>
    <p>Recently I've been building in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. I'm finding the object oriented approach to data handling much more appealing than the array digging I was doing in CakePHP but there are certain things that PHP is just better eqipped to deal with once you get beyond any generic data query type functions.</p>

    <h1>SERVER SIDE SCRIPTING</h1>
    <p><strong>JSP</strong> (Java Server Pages) was my  introduction into the realm of accessing data outside of JAVA. It allowed me to  do basic server side logic determinations based on information I received from  a servlet, which is great when you're in an enterprise class Weblogic environment. <strong>PHP</strong> took me to the next level of server side scripting with its  easy access to <strong>MySQL</strong> databases and minimal system  installation and maintenance. Besides... PHP/MySQL let me write a function in 5  different ways and was so forgiving that I often just guessed and it worked.  Did I just say that out loud?</p>

    <h1>MOBILE</h1>
    <p>I've just started my path down the mobile development road with <strong>IOS7</strong>. It's been tons of fun developing my first mobile app, Flojuggler. Digging into <strong>Objective-C</strong> has strengthened my OOP skills considerably.</p>
    <p><strong>X-Code</strong> is likely the most confusing and controlling IDE I've ever used but it's Apple. They like control and it's not so bad once you get used to it.</p>

    <h1>CODING</h1>
    <!-- <p><strong>IETester</strong> allows a developer to check that most dreaded of requirements, IE6 compliance, without uninstalling a more current browser.</p>
    <p><strong>Subversion</strong> has become a standard for source control but I'm also very familiar with CVS (SmartCVS & command line) and BitKeeper.</p>
    <p><strong>Tortoise SVN</strong> is probably the fastest and most reliable source control GUI I've ever used.</p> -->
    <p><strong>Sublime Text</strong> has become my "goto" editor for coding. The easy plug in architecture is awesome and it has a very small footprint.</p>
    <p><strong>Navicat</strong> saves time for anyone dealing with MySQL databases. It's a stable and robust GUI for a number of databases. I've leaned on it for 5+ years.</p>
    <p><strong>WinSCP</strong> is a life saver for any  telnet client to login, change directories, change file permissions, and so on.   But, you can do it about ten times faster with WinSCP!</p>
    <p><strong>OSX Terminal</strong> is basic.</p>

  <div class="description">
    <h1>PRODUCTION AND PLANNING</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Adobe CS</strong> Suite has become a work horse for front end production flow. It  allows me to design creatively with <strong>Photoshop</strong>/<strong>Illustrator</strong>, while moving into an efficient production phase with <strong>Fireworks</strong>, and coding in <strong>Dreamweaver</strong>/<strong>Flash</strong>. Although Dreamweaver has come a long way, the 'auto-coding' features are more harmful than helpful and I find it more applicable for straight coding instead. However, the  FTP and GREP features can be huge time savers on smaller projects.</p>
    <p>Wireframing and flowcharting are much easier with <strong>Balsamiq</strong> and <strong>Omnigraffle</strong>.
